Amelia is an in-flight assistant/attendant set in a hypothetical cabin in one of NASA's AAM passenger transport drones. Its job is to respond and answer to questions and requests given by the passengers in the cabin with the purpose of improving the overall experience and safety of the flight within the aircraft or drone.

Credit to my team, Team Gold of NASA's NCAS Mission 3 ARC 2024 for the concept.
